# Getting started

For installation guides, you can review our `react` and `vue` section. This section presents a general overview about what is inside.

```ts
const editor = new Editor('my_editor_container')
```

## Editor

## Objects

Objects are editable elements on the canvas. Objects share common properties, specific properties for each object is contained inside `metadata`.

- Text

- Path

```ts
interface CommonProps {
  id: string
  name: string
  top: number
  left: number
  width: number
  height: number

  scaleX: number
  scaleY: number
  stroke: string
  strokeWidth: number
  angle: number
  flipX: boolean

```

Any of these properties can be edited for each object. Objects can be edited using editor controllers.
