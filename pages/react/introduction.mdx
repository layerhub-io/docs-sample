## Adding layehub to your application

In order to use Layehub, you need to do a small setup and wrap the root of your application with `Provider` component:

```tsx
// Provider.ts
import React from 'react'
import { Provider } from '@layerhub-io/react'

export default function ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Provider>
      // Other providers
      {children}
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

Then, you can start using layehub canvas in your application:

```tsx
// Provider.ts
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@layerhub-io/react'

export default function ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '600px', width: '600px', display: 'flex' }}>
      <Canvas />
    </div>
  )
}
```

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'
